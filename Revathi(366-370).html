<p>storage of useless and vast amounts of data, mining can identify and monitor which data<br>
    are most critical to an organization – thereby providing efficient collection, storage, and<br>
    exploration of data (Keim, 2001). The efficiencies associated with mining of “most vital<br>
    data” can result in improved business intelligence, heightened awareness of often<br>
    overlooked relationships in data, and discovery of patterns and rules among data<br>
    elements (Hirji, 2001). Others (http://www.sas.com; Groth, 1998) offer that data mining<br>
    permits improved precision when executing:
    </p>
<ul>
    <li>Fraud Detection and Abuse;</li>
<li>Profitability Analysis;</li>
<li>Customer (Patient) Profiling; and</li>
 <li>Retention Management.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, data mining offers the health care industry the capabilities to tackle<br>
imminent challenges germane to its domain. Among them being:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fraud Detection and Abuse – identification of potential fraud and/or abuse; this<br>
        is applicable to insurance claims processing, verification and payment</li>
    <li>Profitability Analysis – determination of categories of profit and loss levels; this<br>
        can be practical for analyses of diagnosis related groups (DRGs) and managed care<br>
        enrollments</li>
    <li>Patient Profiling – discovery of patients’ health and lifestyle histories as they can<br>
        impact medical coverage and service utilization</li>
    <li>Retention Management – identification of loyal patients and services they use; as<br>
        well as those patients that depart from a particular insurance group, community and<br>
        profile segment</li>
</ul>
<p class="a"><b>COMMUNITY HEALTH INFORMATION<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NETWORKS (CHINS)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the late 1990s and again more recently, CHINs were seen to offer the health<br>
    care industry a platform to address and mine medical data to support public and rural<br>
    health issues. CHINs have been defined as: “Interorganizational systems (IOSs) using<br>
    information technology(ies) and telecommunications to store, transmit, and transform<br>
    clinical and financial information. This information can be shared among cooperative and<br>
    competitive participants, such as payors, hospitals, alternative delivery systems, clinics,<br>
    physicians, and home health agencies” (Brennan, Schneider & Tornquist, 1996; Payton<br>
    & Ginzberg, 2001). IOSs have emerged as a primary business model in a number of<br>
    industries given the application of wireless, application-integration, Internet, and<br>
    broadband technologies. Starting with reservation systems in the airline industry (e.g.,<br>
    the SABRE system), IOSs have been used to implement strategic and competitive<br>
    advantage in the cotton, hospital supply, consumer goods retailing, and automotive<br>
    industries, among others (Clemons & Row, 1993; Copeland & McKenney, 1988). Given<br>
    their intended direction for extensive mining of medical data among health care providers,</p><hr><hr>



    <p>payors, employers, and research institutions, CHINs offer an immediate platform for<br>
        patient profiling, fraud detection, profitability analysis, and retention management.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on a voluntary model of organizational participation, CHINs enable member<br>
        organizations to share health services data in order to meet common objective(s), ranging<br>
        from profit maximization to improvement of public health conditions and wellness.<br>
        Further, CHINs can provide a myriad of services from electronic transaction processing<br>
        to telephone-based referral information (Brennan et al., 1996). The deployment of CHINs<br>
        is confronted with a tremendous number of implementation barriers, largely behavioral<br>
        and political in nature. Among the numerous deterrents, as found in Payton and Ginzberg<br>
        (2001), were loss of organizational autonomy and control; lack of vendor and patient<br>
        support; and lack of understanding of customers’ (patients) needs. Critical to e-health<br>
        models, however, are the data quality issues that enable health care providers, research-<br>ers, payors, and consumers to make more informed medical decisions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooper and Zmud (1990) adopted a diffusion process model of IT implementation<br>
        that is based on stages and processes as outlined in Table 1. Cooper and Zmud suggest<br>
        that the process model can be used as a framework for understanding how critical<br>
        implementation factors evolve over time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooper and Zmud (1990) identify five broad contextual factors that might impact the<br>
        implementation process: user, organization, task, technology, and environment. Their<br>
        description of the implementation process, however, suggests an alternative clustering<br>
        of contextual variables. For instance, they state that, in the initiation stage, “pressure<br>
        to change evolves from either organizational need (pull) technological innovation (push)</p>

    <p>or both” (p. 124). In the adoption stage, they describe the processes of “rational and<br>
        political” negotiations, and in subsequent stages, they suggest that “technology”<br>
        impacts the system implementation. Following this, three factor classes are defined:<br>
        <i>push/pull factors, behavioral factors and shared systems topologies.</i> That is, these sets<br>
        of factors continue to be important as organizations are pressured to change, examine<br>
        opportunities for IOS solutions, obtain organizational backing, develop the IOS appli-<br>cations, and continue to engage in cooperative IOS arrangements.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposed CHIN implementation model is shown in Figure 1. This implementa-<br>tion model is important to academicians and practitioners, alike – as it holds implications<br>
        for data utilization, management, and mining.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Push or pull factors</i> are contextual elements that can impact and influence an<br>
        organization’s willingness to participate in IOS initiatives and include perceived com-<br>petitive advantage (Grover, 1993), competition (Johnston & Vitale, 1988; Copeland &<br>
        McKenney, 1988; Grover, 1993), government actions and policies (Linder, 1992; Ander-<br>son, Aydin & Jay, 1994), and perceived economic benefits (Moritz, 1986).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the Push/Pull Factors, I expected both the <i>economic dimensions</i> and<br>
        <i>government policies</i> to have a positive impact on the implementation effort. Health care<br>
        organizations are currently being pressed toward greater cooperation by government<br>
        decisions, policies, and practices (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, Joint Commission on<br>
        Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, prospective payment system). Further, the<br>
        need to reduce costs while maintaining or increasing quality is a key objective of<br>
        numerous managed care models (Ferrat, Lederer, Hall, & Krella, 1996; Grover, 1993;</p>
    <p><i>Figure 1: Cooperative CHIN implementation model.</i></p>
    <img src="C:\Users\my pc\OneDrive\Desktop\html1/fig1.JPG" width="550px"><hr><hr>
    <p>Kongstvedt, 1989; Little, 1994). <i>Competition</i> among institutions was expected to play<br>
        a minor role, given the rise of community models of health care delivery (Brennan et al.,<br>
        1996; Payton, Brennan, & Ginzberg, 1995), as health care players learn to cooperate and<br>
        collaborate (Ferret et al., 1996) in an effort to overcome the limitations associated with<br>
        previously noted economic dimensions.</p>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behavioral factors</i> relate to attributes and actions of key system stakeholders.<br>
        These include customer support (in this study, the customer is defined as the patient);<br>
        end-user support (Anderson et al., 1994); organizational autonomy and control (Moritz,<br>
        1986); physician, application vendor, and top management support (Anderson et al.,<br>
        1994; Grover, 1993; Lucas, Ginzberg, & Schultz, 1988). In the case of CHINs, application<br>
        vendor support is vital for organizations to gain access to the needed products (Kim &<br>
        Michelman, 1990). Another critical behavioral factor is the political dynamics of the<br>
        implementation process, which often impacts system endorsement and resource commit-<br>ment (Aydin & Rice, 1992; Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Behavioral Factors, <i>quality of CHIN management, vendor support, patient<br>
        support, physician support, and end-user support</i> are all expected to have positive<br>
        impact on implementation progress. Each of these factors has been shown to foster<br>
        change in various intra- and inter-organizational domains (Anderson et al., 1994;<br>
        Clemons & Row, 1993; Grover, 1993; Lucas et al., 1990; Whang, 1992), and thesame result<br>
        should obtain in the CHIN context. Strong <i>autonomy and control</i> of member organiza-<br>tions, however, will tend to inhibit successful CHIN implementation, as organizations<br>
        struggle with the tradeoffs of losing some autonomy to the benefits of shared information<br>
        (Brockhoff & Teichert, 1995). <i>Political factors</i>, arising from conflicting personal and<br>
        organizational objectives among stakeholders, will tend to impede implementation<br>
        progress (Beath, 1991; Linder, 1992).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Shared or integrated systems topologies</i> represent certain aspects of the infra-<br>structure needed for a CHIN. These factors include arrangements for cooperation and<br>
        information sharing, as well as for assuring information quality (Clemons & Row, 1993;<br>
        Kim & Michelman, 1990; Mason, 1991). These cooperative arrangements for CHINs may<br>
        involve physicians, hospitals, third-party payors, laboratories, and pharmacies and will<br>
        require an increased degree of electronic information sharing with anticipated improved<br>
        information quality (Ernst & Young, 1994; Little, 1994).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both elements of Shared System Topologies— <i>information sharing and informa-<br>tion quality</i>-were predicted to have favorable impacts on implementation progress.<br>
        The prior existence of shared systems would provide foundations for building more<br>
        efficient and effective mechanisms for inter-organizational, community-based health<br>
        care delivery. As the degree of information sharing among inter-organizational partici-<br>pants increased, the quality of information available was also expected to increase,<br>
        thereby fostering successful implementation (Clemons & Row, 1993).</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 3%; font-size: 16px;"><b >FINDINGS USING A CASE METHODOLOGY</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, using a case methodology to test the absence or presence of the factors listed<br>
        in Figure 1, the results indicated in Table 2 emerged, based on data collected from 30</p><hr><hr>
    <p>interviews, organizational documentation, participant observation and application dem-<br>onstration.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-depth case data was collected from three voluntary CHIN implementations: the<br>
        Wisconsin Health Information Network (WHIN), Regional Health Information Network<br>
        of Northeast Ohio (RHINNO) and Northeast Ohio Health Network (NEOHN). The<br>
        parallels among these CHINs make them appropriate for investigation. Each CHIN is<br>
        located in the Midwest USA; they cover the range from big city to rural areas, and share<br>
        common initial objectives – i.e., sharing services among multiple health care players with<br>
        the potential to increase profits. In addition, each of these CHINs is thought to have<br>
        technology similarities with regard to data repositories, dedicated telecommunications<br>
        media to enable interorganizational information sharing, and the IS expertise of a single<br>
        vendor for technical, sales and marketing support. Thus, this sample of three CHINs is<br>
        a starting point to uncover patterns in the CHIN/IOS implementation process which can<br>
        later be studied in a broader sample.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results demonstrate that WHIN, NEOHN, and RHINNO represent CHINs that<br>
        have met with different degrees of success. Both NEOHN and RHINNO have experienced<br>
        cycles of interest, investment, and development, but no sustained operation as CHINs.<br></p>
